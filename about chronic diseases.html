                <ol>
                  <li><b>DIABETES :</b></li>
                  <p>-->Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.

                    <p>-->Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.</p>
                    
                    <p>-->With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p>
                  <h4>Types of diabetes :</h4>
                  <p>1.Type - 1</p>
                
                  <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas doesn’t make insulin or makes very little insulin. Insulin helps blood sugar enter the cells in your body for use as energy. Without insulin, blood sugar can’t get into cells and builds up in the bloodstream. High blood sugar is damaging to the body and causes many of the symptoms and complications of diabetes.</p>

                    <p>Type 1 diabetes was once called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes. It usually develops in children, teens, and young adults, but it can happen at any age.</p>
                    
                    <p>Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2—about 5-10% of people with diabetes have type 1. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes, but it can be treated successfully by:</p>
                    
                    <p>Following your doctor’s recommendations for living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>1.Managing your blood sugar.</p>
                    <p>2.Getting regular health checkups.</p>
                    <p>3.Getting diabetes self-management education and support.</p>
                <p>2.Type - 2</p>

                <p>More than 37 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), and approximately 90-95% of them have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over age 45, but more and more children, teens, and young adults are also developing it.</p>

                <p>-->Insulin is a key player in developing type 2 diabetes. This vital hormone—you can’t survive without it—regulates blood sugar (glucose) in the body, a very complicated process. Here are the high points:

                  <p>-->The food you eat is broken down into blood sugar,Blood sugar enters your bloodstream, which signals the pancreas to release insulin.</p>

                  <p>-->Insulin helps blood sugar enter the body’s cells so it can be used for energy,Insulin also signals the liver to store blood sugar for later use.</p>

                  <p>Blood sugar enters cells, and levels in the bloodstream decrease, signaling insulin to decrease too,Lower insulin levels alert the liver to release stored blood sugar so energy is always available, even if you haven’t eaten for a while.</p>

                  <li><b>Cancer<b></li>
                    <p>Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world.</p>
