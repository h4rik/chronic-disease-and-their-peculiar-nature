              <li><b>DIABETES :</b></li>
              <p>Before affecting with diabetes</p>
                <p>-->1.Lose extra weight</p>
                
                <p>-->The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with prediabetes lose at least 7% to 10% of their body weight to prevent disease progression. More weight loss will translate into even greater benefits</p>
                <p>Set a weight-loss goal based on your current body weight. Talk to your doctor about reasonable short-term goals and expectations, such as a losing 1 to 2 pounds a week.</p>
            
                <p>2. Be more physically active</p>

                <p>There are many benefits to regular physical activity. Exercise can help you:
                    • Lose weight
                    • Lower your blood sugar
                    • Boost your sensitivity to insulin — which helps keep your blood sugar within a normal range
                    Goals for most adults to promote weight loss and maintain a healthy weight include:
                
                    • Aerobic exercise. Aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise — such as brisk walking, swimming, biking or running — on most days for a total of at least 150 minutes a week.
                    • Resistance exercise. Resistance exercise — at least 2 to 3 times a week — increases your strength, balance and ability to maintain an active life. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and calisthenics.
                    • Limited inactivity. Breaking up long bouts of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.</p>
                
                <p>-->3. Eat healthy plant foods</p>
                
                <p>Plants provide vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates in your diet. Carbohydrates include sugars and starches — the energy sources for your body — and fiber. Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, is the part of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb.</p>
                <p>Fiber-rich foods promote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes. Eat a variety of healthy, fiber-rich foods, which include:</p>
                <p> • Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees
                    • Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower
                    • Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils
                    • Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa</p>
                <p>The benefits of fiber include:
                    • Slowing the absorption of sugars and lowering blood sugar levels
                    • Interfering with the absorption of dietary fat and cholesterol
                    • Managing other risk factors that affect heart health, such as blood pressure and inflammation
                    • Helping you eat less because fiber-rich foods are more filling and energy rich
                Avoid foods that are "bad carbohydrates" — high in sugar with little fiber or nutrients: white bread and pastries, pasta from white flour, fruit juices, and processed foods with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
            <p>4. Eat healthy fats</p>

            <p>-->Fatty foods are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. To help lose and manage weight, your diet should include a variety of foods with unsaturated fats, sometimes called "good fats."</p>

            <p>Precautions to be taken after Diabetes is attacked:</p>

              <p>-->1. Make a commitment to managing your diabetes</p>

              <p>-->Members of your diabetes care team — primary care provider, diabetes care and education specialist, and dietitian, for example — can help you learn the basics of diabetes care and offer support along the way. But it's up to you to manage your condition.</p>

              <p>Learn all you can about diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Maintain a healthy weight.

                Monitor your blood sugar, and follow your health care provider's instructions for managing your blood sugar level. Take your medications as directed by your health care provider. Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.</p>
              <p>2. Don't smoke
                Avoid smoking or quit smoking if you smoke. Smoking increases your risk of type 2 diabetes and the risk of various diabetes complications, including:
                    • Reduced blood flow in the legs and feet, which can lead to infections, nonhealing ulcers and possible amputation
                    • Worse blood sugar control
                    • Heart disease
                    • Stroke
                    • Eye disease, which can lead to blindness
                    • Nerve damage
                    • Kidney disease
                    • Premature death
                
                Talk to your health care provider about ways to help you stop smoking or using other types of tobacco.
                3. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control
                Like diabetes, high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels. High cholesterol is a concern, too, since the resulting damage is often worse and more rapid when you have diabetes. When these conditions team up, they can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other life-threatening conditions.
                
                Eating a healthy, reduced-fat and low salt diet, avoiding excess alcohol, and exercising regularly can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol. Your health care provider may also recommend taking prescription medication, if necessary.
                4. Schedule regular physicals and eye exams
                Schedule two to four diabetes checkups a year, in addition to your yearly physical and routine eye exams.
                During the physical, your health care provider will ask about your nutrition and activity level and look for any diabetes-related complications — including signs of kidney damage, nerve damage and heart disease — as well as screen for other medical problems. He or she will also examine your feet for any issues that may need treatment.
                
                Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts and glaucoma.</p>
              <li>Cancer</li>
                <p>Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world.</p>
                <p>Types of Cancers :</p>
                  <p>->Lung cancer</p>
                  <p>->Kidney cancer</p>
                  <p>->Breast cancer</p>
                  <p>Now let us see details about each cancer disease</p>
                  <p>1.Lung Cancer </p>
                  <p>-->Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale.</p>
                  <p>-->Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.</p>                        
                  <p>-->People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer, though lung cancer can also occur in people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes you've smoked. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer.</p>
                  <p>2.Kidney cancer</p>
                  <p>-->Kidney cancer is cancer that begins in the kidneys. Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fist. They're located behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine.    
                  <p>-->In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other less common types of kidney cancer can occur. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumor.</p>
                  <p>-->The incidence of kidney cancer seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the accidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often discovered at an early stage, when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney</p>
                  <p>3.Breast cancer</p>
                  <p>-->Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.</p>
                  <p>-->After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.</p>
                  <p>-->Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped create advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease</p>
            <li>Arthritis</li>
                <p>-->Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
                <p>-->Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.</p>
                <p>-->Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.</p>
                <p>-->Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life</p>
                <p>Types of Arthritis</p>
                    <p>1.Osteoarthritis.</p>
                        <p>-->Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Some people call it degenerative joint disease or “wear and tear” arthritis. It occurs most frequently in the hands, hips, and knees.</p>
                    <p>2.Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p>
                        <p>-->Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, which means that your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing inflammation (painful swelling) in the affected parts of the body.</p>
                    <p>3.Gout.</p>
                        <p>-->Gout is a common form of inflammatory arthritis that is very painful. It usually affects one joint at a time (often the big toe joint). There are times when symptoms get worse, known as flares, and times when there are no symptoms, known as remission. Repeated bouts of gout can lead to gouty arthritis, a worsening form of arthritis.</p>
                    <p>4.Fibromyalgia.</p>
                        <p>-->Fibromyalgia (fi·bro·my·al·gi·a) is a condition that causes pain all over the body (also referred to as widespread pain), sleep problems, fatigue, and often emotional and mental distress.</p>
                    <p>5.Childhood Arthritis<p>
                        <p>Arthritis in children is called childhood arthritis or juvenile arthritis. The most common type of childhood arthritis is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
            <li>Heart disease<li>
                <p>-->The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.</p>
                <p>-->The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases.</p>
                <p>Types of heart diseases</p>
                    <p>1.Angina</p>
                        <P>-->Chest pain from lack of blood flow</P>
                    <p>2.Heart attacks</p>
                        <p>-->When part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow</p>
                    <p>3.Heart failure</p> 
                        <p>-->When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs</p>
                    <p>4.Arrhythmia</p> 
                        <p>-->A problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat</p>
